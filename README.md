- Created a Python script that analyzes the financial records of a company using the financial data called [Budget Data](/PyBank_Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.
- The Python script calculates the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
- Printed the final analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.:rocket:
